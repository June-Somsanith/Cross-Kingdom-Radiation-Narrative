This abstract presents a novel approach to understanding the impact of radiation in spaceflight on eukaryotic organisms through a cross-kingdom species analysis. Leveraging datasets from various species spaceflight studies, we focused on tissue-specific insights to ensure comprehensive coverage. Employing R, we merged genomic data from GeneLab with a factors matrix encompassing species, strain, tissue type, hardware, treatment, and gravitational factor information. Subsequently, Idep software facilitated the initial analysis of genomic data and KEGG pathways across Arabidopsis thaliana, mice, and humans, unveiling dysregulations and identifying specific loci indicative of cross-kingdom impacts. GeneLabâ€™s multi-study visualization software augmented our analysis, confirming previous findings and introducing novel avenues for genetic comparisons. This comprehensive approach sheds light on broader patterns within eukaryotic organisms subjected to radiation in spaceflight conditions, offering insights into potential the impacts on mechanisms underlying physiological adaptations and vulnerabilities across species boundaries. By merging diverse datasets and employing advanced analytical techniques, our study contributes to the growing body of knowledge concerning the effects of radiation in space environments on biological systems, with implications for space exploration and human health.
