**Challenges of radiation in space**
Explaining all the challenges of radiation in spaceflight for biological organisms could take well over the 10 minute time limit I have.
Spaceflight presents a multitude of challenges, with radiation being a significant concern for the health and safety of astronauts. Exposure to space radiation increases the risk of developing cancer, central nervous system (CNS) decrements, degenerative tissue effects, and acute radiation syndrome in humans and mice (cite) and in plants it can cause morphological, anatomical, and DNA alterations and damage (Arena et al., 2014). Shielding may be effective against solar particle events (SPEs) but it is insufficient against the biological impacts of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) nuclei, particularly during long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). In deep space, we donâ€™t have the luxury of a protective atmosphere. Instead, we are exposed to highly ionizing particles with different radiation types and delivery rates that are significantly higher than what we experience on Earth. This radiation exposure induces more severe effects morphological, anatomical, and biological functions.
Space radiation has been shown to induce certain cancers in mice, cause inflammation, tissue degradation, decreased nerve function (Barker et al., 2021). From previous studies conducted across multiple species, thereâ€™s evidence to suggest different genetic factors influence the degrees of radiation tolerance.

**Previous studies and why they matter**
The new software and technologies developing are allowing for scientists' use of a more holistic approach to space research. With tools such as Genelabâ€™s multi-viz software and Idep, we are able to analyze the data of past studies with and against other previous studies for a more complex understanding of current research.
The utilization of previous spaceflight studies is pivotal for advancing our understanding of space research and addressing the challenges associated with long-duration missions. The emergence of new software and technologies, such as Genelab's multi-viz software and Idep, has revolutionized the way scientists analyze and interpret data from past studies, enabling a more holistic approach to space research.
One key aspect of leveraging previous spaceflight studies is the accumulation of knowledge and data over time. Each space mission, whether manned or unmanned, contributes valuable data on various aspects of space exploration, including radiation exposure, physiological effects of microgravity, and can help improve spacecraft technology performance. By synthesizing data from multiple missions, we can identify trends, patterns, and correlations that may not be apparent from individual studies alone.
Utilizing software available to us can play a crucial role in this process by providing tools for data visualization, integration, and analysis. Researchers can compare and contrast data from different experiments, missions, and even organisms, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the biological and environmental factors influencing spaceflight outcomes. This comparative analysis enables researchers to identify commonalities, discrepancies, and areas for further investigation.
The integration of past studies into current research frameworks provides a solid foundation for hypothesis generation and experimental design. By building upon existing knowledge and leveraging historical data, scientists can formulate more targeted research questions and hypotheses, maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of future spaceflight experiments.
Studying the effects of spaceflight on various organisms across multiple missions can reveal valuable insights into the universality or species-specific nature of physiological responses to space environments. For example, comparing the genetic and molecular responses of different organisms to space radiation exposure can shed light on common mechanisms of radiation resistance or sensitivity, which was the aim of this research.
