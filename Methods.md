**Why these 5 studies?**

For this multi-study cross-kingdom analysis, I limited myself to only using 5 different datasets. Once you cross the threshold of 5 studies, the data starts to get very convoluted.
These particular 5 studies are based on a few factors: Ion radiation, gravitational factor, organism, and tissue. My goal was to combine the new Genlab multi-viz software analysis with my own analysis and cross-compare the results to find the similarities and differences, however there were a few roadblocks that prevented me from initiating this with all the different factors included. The Genelab multi-viz software only does visualizations with data that has Deseq2 normalization but not all the studies I wanted to include in my analysis had this. 
With these parameters, the pool of studies was actually quite small. In fact, I didn’t have a fly study to incorporate at the beginning. I went back to reanalyze and data and double check studies later in march and lucky I did because a new fly study had been published and it was the only one to fit the parameters. 

**Is this a holistic approach?**
Depending on your subjectivity, this may be seen as a more holistic approach to analyzing dysregulated genes exposed to radiation and to some extent it is: we are looking at multiple organisms and multiple body parts with different functions. At this point in our research, there are so many options of tissues to choose from. I implore and encourage you if you are interested to conduct your own research or proposal and discussion on studies or tissues types or factors you would like to be analyzed. Using the Genelab multi-visualization portal is a great place to start, however, it shouldn’t be your limiting factor of which studies you choose to analyze. Not all of the studies I chose and will be showing you have visualizations available.
